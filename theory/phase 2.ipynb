    "The purpose of this task is to find out what the weather will be for a particular place in Australia. This is important as it allows people to plan their day accordingly; bring a jumper if it's going to be cold, an umbrella if it's going to rain, etc. I feel it's necessary to carry out this analysis as it can provide another viewpoint to what the weather may be; so people can make a more informed guess by looking at this different algorithm which may be more or less accurate than the real weather prediction but then be able to compare it with the current predictions for maximum accuracy. Everyone can benefit and use the info this will create; everyone wants to know how their day will be - from planning an outing to deciding whether or not to bring a jumper to work.\n",
