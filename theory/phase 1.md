# Phase 1: Identifying and Defining
- Choose Your Data Scenario: You'll be working with different data scenarios such as weather data, bushfire
data, or solar power data. Pick one that interests you the most.
    > The data I want to analyze is the weather data.
- Define Your Purpose: Clearly state what you aim to achieve with your analysis. What questions are you
trying to answer? What's the main goal?
    > The main goal of this is to predict the weather forecast. I am trying to answer the question of 'Will it rain?' My data output will include the weather forecast for the next 7 days; the chance of rain and temperature prediction ranges (i.e. max and min temps) for each day.
- Specify Requirements: List down the functional (what your project should do) and non-functional
(qualities like speed or security) requirements for your project. Be specific.
    - Functional:
        - > Speed: The program should be fast in order to provide the user with a better interface and quick response.
        - > Accuracy: The program should be able to provide the user with a correct range of temperature and chance of rain; so the user can plan their day accordingly.
        - > API: The program should be able to be called by an API service to provide more applications of this product.
    - Non-Functional:
        - > Asthetics: The program needs to look good so people can have a nice time using the product

## IDEA
What if I made a JavaScript version of this so I can host it on Github pages?
