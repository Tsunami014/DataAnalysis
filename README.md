# Data analysis
A cool project

This is a flask web application which *currently* can show **some** rainfall and temperature data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology from a lot of their different weather stations.

The goal for this project is to make a program that can predict the temperature and rainfall for a certain place

## TODOS
 - [ ] Get data for EVERY place
 - [ ] Get more data (cloud coverage, maybe?)
 - [ ] Build the neural network
 - [ ] Make sliders to adjust things for the neural network
 - [x] Animate the ... on the loading panel
 - [ ] Add a lot more of the spinning ...'s everywhere
 - [ ] Round the edges of all the plots
 - [ ] Rename 'store files' to 'File downloading and cleaning' to be more precise and clear
 - [x] **ERROR HANDLING**
 - [x] Show where *you* are currently on the map
 - [ ] Show where you are getting the data from on the map

And ***JEEZ*** TensorFlow SUCKS **SO MUCH**. Sorry for any extra pain.
