# Data analysis
A cool project

This is a flask web application which *currently* can show **some** rainfall and temperature data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology from a lot of their different weather stations.

The goal for this project is to make a program that can predict the temperature and rainfall for a certain place

If you cannot get the installation to work, try running
```bash
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.11.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## TODOS
 - [ ] Get data for EVERY place
 - [ ] Get more data (cloud coverage, maybe?)
 - [ ] Build the neural network
 - [ ] Animate the ... on the loading panel
 - [ ] Add a lot more of the spinning ...'s everywhere
 - [ ] Round the edges of all the plots
 - [ ] **ERROR HANDLING**
 - [ ] Show where *you* are currently on the map
 - [ ] Show where you are getting the data from on the map

And ***JEEZ*** TensorFlow SUCKS **SO MUCH**. Sorry for any extra pain.
